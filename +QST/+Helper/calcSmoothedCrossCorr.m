function [Y_Smoothed] = calcSmoothedCrossCorr(Xa,Xb,Options)
% SMOOTHCROSSCORR returns the crosscorrelation of two Matrices of same
% shape and smoothes it using either Spline Interpolation or MovingWindow
% Averaging
%
% INPUTS:
% Xa :                  First Matrix
% Xb :                  Second Matrix

% OPTIONS:
% Type :                    Type of Interpolation. It has to be either "Spline" for Spline Interpolation
%                           or "MovingAverage" for Moving Window Averaging. For
%                           later an algorithm of Carlos Adri√°n Vargas Aguilera
%                           has been used. The Accuracy of the smoothing is
%                           given by the to Accuracy Options
% Accuracy_Spline :         Accuracy of the Spline Interpolation. The Value has
%                           to be between 0 and 1, where the actual accuracy to the data increases
%                           nonlinear towards 1 (see csaps doc). Default Value
%                           is 1e-15
% Accuracy_MovingAverage:   Accuracy of the Moving Window Average Interpolation. It defines the Size of the used Window in datapoints.
%                           Default value is 20
