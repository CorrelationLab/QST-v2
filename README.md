# QST-v2
A package written in matlab to analyse data aquired by multichannel homodyne detection. The codes are partially rewritings of the package by CarolinLueders and nMerlin ('https://github.com/CarolinLueders/QST')



Notifications:
'QST.Variable_Managment.getVariableFromMat' should replace 'QST.Variable_Managment.getVariableFromMat'. But right now it still returns the found Variable as a struct, which should not be.
