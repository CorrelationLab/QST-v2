File_Managment:
	Validators:
		- DONE validate by file extension
		- DONE validate by regular expression

	Directories and Files:
		- DONE get all subdirectories of a given directory
		- DONE get all files of all subdirectories of a given directory
	
	MetaData:
		- DONE get Metadata information from path/String by given regular expression

-> Combination of functions from 'Directories and Files' and 'Validators' allows to get every wanted Subset of files and subdirectories  





	








Handlers (Experimental):
	- FIRST IMPLEMENTATION execute a function based on variables of a .mat file of given path and save the result again
	- FIRST IMPLEMENTATION execute a function based on variables of a .mat file of given path and collect the result in a cell array.

-> These handlers are still highly experimental and unstable, but they would allows to execute any given function on a set of files
